# AWS Application Migration Service

AWS Application Migration Service (AWS MGN) is the primary service recommended for lift-and-shift migrations to AWS. It allows you to migrate existing, virtual, and cloud-based servers to AWS with minimal changes and downtime. AWS MGN provides real-time block-level replication and automated testing, ensuring a smooth and efficient migration process while minimizing disruption to your operations.

## How it works

### Install AWS Replication Agent:
The process begins by installing the AWS Replication Agent on your source servers. This agent handles the continuous replication of data to AWS.

### Replication:
The replication process occurs in real-time, capturing all changes to the source servers' disk volumes. The replicated data is stored in a staging area in your AWS account.

### Launch Test Instances:
AWS MGN allows you to launch test instances using the replicated data. These test instances can be used to verify application functionality and performance in the cloud.

### Cutover:
When ready, you can initiate a cutover by launching the fully replicated and tested instances in AWS. The service ensures minimal downtime during the cutover process.

## Benefits
### Cost-Efficiency:
By using AWS MGN, organizations can avoid the cost and complexity of traditional on-premises infrastructure, benefiting from the pay-as-you-go pricing model of AWS.

### Scalability:
AWS MGN supports the migration of applications regardless of their size, scale, or complexity, allowing for easy scaling in the cloud environment.

### Reduced Downtime:
The continuous replication and efficient cutover processes ensure minimal disruption to your business operations.

### Simplified Migration:
AWS MGN simplifies the migration process, eliminating the need for extensive manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors
